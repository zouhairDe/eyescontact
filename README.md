## Description

The Eye Tracking and Privacy App is a fun and interactive web application that features two animated eyes that follow the movement of the mouse cursor.
The application also includes a button that allows users to toggle the visibility of the eyes on and off.
Additionally, there's an input field that, when clicked, changes its attribute to "password" to hide the entered text for added privacy.
